Interface.y is my first version, Main.py is my latest,
There are a lot of changes including a scrolling bar feature for when classes get to big Furthermore there a lot more function.

pycirrus.py is my original cloud module that i am using to run the application interface, but from that pycirrus2.py came out which is updated and allows for anyone to access the code


Newest update:
the way the application works is that it connects to the users dropbox and it gets fils that it downloads updates and uploads back to the users dropbox. The way it works is it make a CSV style folder for every  class. Furthermore everytime a class is made two files are made. One class is made that stores data, and another that renames the file with a unique name. This file is for checking that two users don't access the same data So overtime something is going to be grabbed or changes it aches the second file to make sure that no one is changing data.
